# The code is straightforward. Each model is represented by a class that subclasses django.db.models.Model. 
# Each model has a number of class variables, each of which represents a database field in the model.

# Each field is represented by an instance of a Field class â€“ e.g., CharField for character fields and 
# DateTimeField for datetimes. This tells Django what type of data each field holds.
